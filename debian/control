Description: JPEG-XR lib - libraries
 JPEG XR is an approved ISO/IEC International standard (its official
 designation is ISO/IEC 29199-2).
 .
 JPEG XR started its life in Microsoft Research. It publicly first appeared as
 the HD Photo format in Windows Vista.
 .
 For web developers, JPEG XR has a large number of interesting features, see
 the table below. Some of these are big advantages over other image formats
 like JPEG, PNG, OpenEXR, and TIFF.
  - Better Compression (40% smaller than JPEG)
  - Lossless Mode (better compression than PNG)
  - Alpha Channel (compress color lossy and alpha losslessly)
  - Extended Bitdepth (supports 8-, 16-, and 32-bit/channel)
  - Progressive Decode
  - Advanced Decoding Features (tile-based layout, for efficient
    region-of-interest access.)
